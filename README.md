# ML-Env-Setup

To avoid losing out on any variables already stored in your ~/.bashrc file, you can add an additional line to ~/.zshrc file.

`source ~/.bashrc`
This will load anything specific to your bashrc file already present.


Common Problems
1. If you have shifted from bash to zsh, then VSCode "+" button will still select the "bash" as the default shell.
2. You can change this by pressing "+", then pressing "Select Default Profile" and then choosing "zsh".
